# BITNATION - How To Code Your Own Nation (And Change The World)


NOTE: I first started writing privately about the subject of competing non-territorial governance service providers when I was about 20 years old, in 2003. In October 2012 I signed a book deal with Nortia Press to write a book about the idea - then called "The Googlement". I travelled for over a year to research city states, self-governing communities, and radical technologists. During those travels, particularly after having red Lex Cryptographia and having looked into the Ethereum smart contract ideas, it became clear to me that the idea wouldn't be as hard to implement as I had thought initially - hence I decided to *do it* rather than to write about it. Hence, I started BITNATION, the world's first blockchain Nation. I've recently picked up writing about it again, as I'm providing guidance and tools to other setting up their own Nations on Bitnation.
